        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>

                In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
                In a separate bowl, beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs and melted butter.
                Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.

                Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. 
                You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready!

                Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together.
                The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake.
                Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. 
                Repeat with remaining batter.
            </p>

    </ol>
